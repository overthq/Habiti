// Initial list of actions we want to send user a notification for:
// - New order (store managers)
// - Payout confirmed (when Paystack confirms the transaction is sent)
// - New follower (store managers)
// - Order fulfilled (user)
// - Delivery confirmed (store managers)

// Architecture:
// When we call ctx.services.notifications.queueMessage(...), a message gets
// added to the queue. Every minute (or maybe 15 seconds), we get all items
// in the queue and dump them into the expo.chunkPushNotifications(...)
// method, which chunks and sends them.
//
// In the future, we can also commit the messages if they reach a certain
// count threshold and/or tweak the batch time.
//
// I'm a little worried that it isn't trivial to implement something that
// works at scale here. Resetting messages to an empty array is a little
// risky, if it's possible for that array to have been appended to after
// chunking. A very trivial way to mitigate this is to store the array length
// before chunking and check if it has changed after.
//
// Who ever said that mutexes aren't useful?
